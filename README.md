# Poetry sandbox

>  This repository is intended to be used to dig into poetry's basic usage

The main goal is to be able to setup project depenencies using poetry.

## About poetry

*From the documentation*

> Poetry is a tool to hanle dependency installation as well as building and packaging of Python pacages. It only needs one file to do all of that: the new, standardized pyproject.toml. In other words, poetry uses pyproject.toml to replace setup.py, requirements.txt, setup.cfg, MANIFEST.in and the newly added Pipfile.


### Poetry installation

```sh
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sdispater/poetry/master/get-poetry.py | python

```

or

```
pip install --user poetry
```

add poetry to path

```
POETRY_BINS="$HOME/.poetry/bin"
if [ -d "$POETRY_BINS" ]; then
  path_ladd "$POETRY_BINS"
fi
```

### Poetry autocompletion

```sh
# Bash
poetry completions bash > /etc/bash_completion.d/poetry.bash-completion

# Bash (macOS/Homebrew)
poetry completions bash > $(brew --prefix)/etc/bash_completion.d/poetry.bash-completion # Fish poetry completions fish > ~/.config/fish/completions/poetry.fish # Zsh
